# Bike Store Analyst Project

## Project Description
The Bike Store Analyst project is a comprehensive analysis and visualization of a bike store's database. Using SQL for data extraction and analysis, this project culminates in a rich, interactive dashboard created in Tableau that highlights key metrics and trends important to the bike store's operations.

## Data Source
The data for this analysis is sourced from two SQL files:
1. `BikeStores Sample Database - create objects.sql` - This file contains SQL commands to create the necessary database objects.
2. `BikeStores Sample Database - load data.sql` - This file is used to load data into the database.

## Analysis Process
We use SQL for detailed data analysis, focusing on aspects such as sales trends, customer demographics, and inventory management. The analysis process is documented in the provided Jupyter Notebook (`Notebook-1.ipynb`).

## Tableau Visualization
The analyzed data is visualized using Tableau, providing an interactive and user-friendly dashboard. This dashboard allows for easy exploration of data trends and key metrics. You can view the dashboard here: [Bike Store Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/linh.vu8743/viz/BikeStoreDashboard_17053591031050/Dashboard1).

## Installation and Usage
To use this project:
1. Set up a SQL database using the scripts provided.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook for detailed analysis steps.
3. Explore the Tableau dashboard for visual insights.
